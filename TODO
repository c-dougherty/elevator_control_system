TODO:
  - Add passenger limit for elevators
  - Add waiting line (queue) for each floor
  - Improve elevator scheduling algorithm (think about process scheduling, disk SCAN, etc.)
  - Finish elevator system scheduling
  - Add test module (simplified time-stepper):
      + Randomly generate users with requests and add users to floor queue
      + Repeatedly have elevators process requests
  
  - Update documentation
